taskc: debugging newton's method, now with new epic quadratic minimization
f(x) = 1 + x^3: roots[0] = -1.00000363700432 (known sol at x = -1)
f(x) = (x^2 + y^2, x + 3): roots[0] = 0.999855316740421 roots[1] = 2.00014468325333 (known sol at (x,y) = (1,2))
finding the minimum of the 2D Rosenbrock function: roots[0] = 1 roots[1] = 1 (known sol at (x,y) = (1,1))
finding the minima of the Himmelblau fcn, of which there are four; therefore, we ought to make four separate trials beginning in the vicinity of a known solution. the known solutions are (3,2), (-2.805,3.131), (-3.780,-3.283), and (3.584,-1.848). (sol1): roots[0] = 2.99999920602882 roots[1] = 2.00000336406261 (sol2): roots[0] = -2.80511808245505 roots[1] = 3.13131261736788 (sol3): roots[0] = -3.77931062173071 roots[1] = -3.28318724617744 (sol4): roots[0] = 3.5844283421855 roots[1] = -1.84812654679871
