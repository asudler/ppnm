A few comments regarding this assigment:
* _task (b)_: planet1 is the circular Newtonian orbit, planet2 is the elliptical Newtonian orbit, and---believe it or not---planet3 is the orbit with relativistic precession. The plot contains an image with all three datasets.
* _task (c)_: I could not find the initial conditions for the figure eight pattern on the [three-body problem Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem), so I stole the parameters that one of my classmates used... sorry...
* _task (c)_: "threebody raw" contains the output of my driver without interpolation for the figure eight pattern. "threebody interp" contains the figure eight pattern from the raw output, but with interpolation. ``threebody fun" was just a bit of silly business with random parameters :)
