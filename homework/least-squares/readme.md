_The uncertainty of the logarithm of a dataset (from [UMass](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/225523/how-to-write-partial-differential-equation-ex-dq-dt-ds-dt-with-real-partial-d)):_

Given a function of a single variable $f(y)$, the uncertainty on $f$, called $\delta_f$, is related to the uncertainty on $y$, called $\delta_y$, through the formula $$\delta_f = \sqrt{\left(\frac{df,dy})^2 \delta_y^2}.$$
