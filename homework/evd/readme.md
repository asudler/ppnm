Attempting homework "EVD" (eigenvalue decomposition) via the implementation of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm. I will use the matrix and vector classes from lineq, which were originally provided by Dmitri.

(b) It appears the converged groundstate energy is 0.5 Hartrees, which we can get pretty close to by setting dr = 0.05 and rmax = 20. Also, sorry that my datafiles look ugly :( since I am redirecting the standard output, it always prints my function message. But gnuplot does not read these lines, so I hope it's OK!
