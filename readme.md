Practical Programming and Numerical Methods at Aarhus University Spring 2024

# Information
This repository contains my code for Practical Programming and Numerical Methods, a programming class which teaches applied programming techniques and numerical methods for physics and mathematics students. The course was taught by Prof. Dmitri Fedorov. For more information about the class, please see the [course homepage](http://212.27.24.106:8080/prog/).

_Exercises_ were meant to teach us the basics of programming in C-sharp. _Homework_ contains implementations of applied numerical methods useful for physics students.

As of 2024-03-18, I have completed all of the exercises. My progress on the homeworks is indicated by a readme file in the homework subdirectory.
